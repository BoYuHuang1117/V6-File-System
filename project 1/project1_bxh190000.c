/**
     * if a program contains a call to fork( ), 
     * the execution of the program results in the execution of two processes. 
     * One process is created to start executing the program. 
     * When the fork( ) system call is executed, another process is created. 
     * The original process is called the parent process and the second process is 
     * called the child process.
     
     * The child process is an almost exact copy of the parent process. 
     * Both processes continue executing from the point where the fork( ) calls returns 
     * execution to the main program. Since UNIX is a time-shared operating system, 
     * the two processes can execute concurrently.
